Sinusitis
=========

A basic touch-driven music instrument, designed for Firefox OS and web-browsers.

## Usage

Slide your finger on the the blue zone in the center to play a sine noise !

The screen has two axis : the horizontal one determines the pitch of the sound, while the vertical one determines its velocity.

## About this app

This app has been created by *Nicolas Hurtubise*. It is distributed under the terms of the MIT License, and it is therefore free as in free speech. Do whatever you like with it.

Also, as the license says, **This software is provided "AS IS"**. You will be the only responsible if you destroy your speakers with this app.

## Compatibility

Since the app is based on experimental HTML5 technology, not all browsers can run it. To date, I tested it on Firefox and the Firefox OS simulator (which both support the required functionnalities) and on Chromium 34 (which doesn't).
